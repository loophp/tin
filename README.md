# Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) Validator

## Description

A library to validate TIN numbers for individuals. This is based on a Java
library, this is why the code does not reflect best practices in PHP (yet).

Supported countries:

- Austria (AT)
- Belgium (BE)
- Bulgaria (BG)
- Croatia (HR)
- Cyprus (CY)
- Czech Republic (CZ)
- Denmark (DK)
- Estonia (EE)
- Finland (FI)
- France (FR)
- Germany (DE)
- Greece (GR) - only size
- Hungary (HU)
- Ireland (IE)
- Italy (IT)
- Latvia (LV) - no check digit
- Lithuania (LT)
- Luxembourg (LU)
- Malta (MT) - no check digit
- Netherlands (NL)
- Poland (PL)
- Portugal (PT)
- Romania (RO) - no check digit
- Slovakia (SK) - only structure
- Slovenia (SI)
- Spain (ES)
- Sweden (SE)
- United Kingdom (UK) - only structure

If your country is not there, feel free to open an issue with your country code,
and a link to the specification. Ideally, you can provide a pull request with
the algorithm and the tests.

## Requirements

- PHP >= 8.1

## Usage & API

To simply check the validity of a TIN number:

```php
<?php

include __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use loophp\Tin\TIN;

$bool = TIN::fromSlug('be71102512345')->isValid();
```

If you want to get the reason why a number is invalid, you can use

```php
<?php

include __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use loophp\Tin\TIN;
use loophp\Tin\Exception\TINException;

try {
    TIN::fromSlug('be71102512345')->check();
} catch (TINException $e) {
    // do something with the exception.
}
```

## Strict Mode

If you want to use a stricter method (without normalizing the TIN number, that is, using the raw TIN number), use the `strict` parameter in the `check` or `isValid` functions as shown below (Introduced in [#39](https://github.com/loophp/tin/pull/39)). By default, it is set to `false`.

```php
TIN::fromSlug('be7110.2512345')->check(); // Not strict
TIN::fromSlug('be7110.2512345')->check(strict: false); // Not strict
TIN::fromSlug('be7110.2512345')->check(true); // Strict
TIN::fromSlug('be7110.2512345')->check(strict: true); // Strict


## Installation

`composer require loophp/tin`

## Code quality, tests and benchmarks

Every time changes are introduced into the library,
[Github](https://github.com/loophp/tin/actions) run the tests and the
benchmarks.

The library has tests written with [PHPSpec](http://www.phpspec.net/). Feel free
to check them out in the `spec` directory. Run `composer phpspec` to trigger the
tests.

Before each commit some inspections are executed with
[GrumPHP](https://github.com/phpro/grumphp), run `./vendor/bin/grumphp run` to
check manually.

[PHPInfection](https://github.com/infection/infection) is used to ensure that
your code is properly tested, run `composer infection` to test your code.
